# PayAfterCure Platform Redesign

> 🚧 In Progress — Full-stack redesign of an active homeopathy platform serving 200+ monthly users

## Overview

**PayAfterCure** is a personalized homeopathy service where users only pay once they see results. This project modernizes the legacy PHP-based site into a responsive, scalable React application with an accompanying iOS mobile app. The new platform improves accessibility, user experience, and long-term maintainability.

My dad has run this business for 10+ years and I am revamping his effort to increase reach.

## Features

- ⚙️ **React-based frontend** built from scratch to replace outdated PHP site
- 📱 **iOS mobile application** to allow seamless cross-device access
- 📂 Modular UI with reusable components using Bootstrap and React Hooks
- 🧠 Future-ready backend integration with Firebase and/or custom API
- 🧾 Intake form, appointment tracking, and account management UX
- 🔒 Planned enhancements for authentication and payment integration

## Tech Stack

| Bootstrap      | Xcode          | Figma (UI Design)  |
